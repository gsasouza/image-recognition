# open-images-dataset-frcnn
A project that uses Faster R-CNN for image recognition using [Open Images Dataset](https://github.com/openimages/dataset) to train the models.

It based in these two projects: 
- [Faster R-CNN (object detection) implemented by Keras for custom data from Googleâ€™s Open Images Dataset V4](https://towardsdatascience.com/faster-r-cnn-object-detection-implemented-by-keras-for-custom-data-from-googles-open-images-125f62b9141a)
- [OIDv4 ToolKit](https://github.com/EscVM/OIDv4_ToolKit)

And is intended to run o [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)


# Results

I first trained it to identify a caterpillar, it was tested from a random google images picture and with a picture that I take
